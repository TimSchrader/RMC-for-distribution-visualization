# Reverse Monte Carlo for distribution visualization

[![Run this App online](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://rmc-for-distribution-visualization.streamlit.app/)

This is a simple implementation of a [Reverse Monte Carlo algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Monte_Carlo) for visualizing a distribution using only simple constraints. This is useful if you need to visualize a distribution while making very few assumptions about it.

### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
